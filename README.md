# Nested_Reply
creating a Reddit like website that provides a flexible comment/reply system
Create a UI in React that does the following task:
You are creating a Reddit like website that provides a flexible comment/reply system like below where reply can be nested arbitrarily.

This is reply 1.
    This is reply to reply 1. 
    This is another reply to reply 1.
        This is reply to second reply of reply 1.
This is reply 2. 
You don’t need any other features of Reddit or the same colour scheme—just the comment section, which allows replying.
There is no need to implement persistence or server-side stuff—just the UI.
